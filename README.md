## 🌟 Overview

**GenericAgent** is a minimal, self-evolving autonomous agent framework. Its core is just **~3K lines of code**. Through **9 atomic tools + a ~100-line Agent Loop**, it grants any LLM system-level control over a local computer — covering browser, terminal, filesystem, keyboard/mouse input, screen vision, and mobile devices (ADB).

Its design philosophy: **don't preload skills — evolve them.**

Every time GenericAgent solves a new task, it automatically crystallizes the execution path into an skill for direct reuse later. The longer you use it, the more skills accumulate — forming a skill tree that belongs entirely to you, grown from 3K lines of seed code.

> **🤖 Self-Bootstrap Proof** — Everything in this repository, from installing Git and running `git init` to every commit message, was completed autonomously by GenericAgent. The author never opened a terminal once.

> **📝 Personal Note** — I'm using this fork to explore the self-evolution mechanism and experiment with Claude as the backend model. The skill accumulation approach is particularly interesting for long-running personal automation workflows.

## 📋 Core Features
- **Self-Evolving**: Automatically crystallizes each task into an skill. Capabilities grow with every use, forming your personal skill tree.
- **Minimal Architecture**: ~3K lines of core code. Agent Loop is ~100 lines. No complex dependencies, zero deployment overhead.
- **Strong Execution**: Injects into a real browser (preserving login sessions). 9 atomic tools take direct control of the system.
- **High Compatibility**: Supports Claude / Gemini / Kimi / MiniMax and other major models. Cross-platform.
- **Token Efficient**: <30K context window — a fraction of the 200K–1M other agents consume. Layered memory ensures the right knowledge is always in scope. Less noise, fewer hallucinations, higher success rate — at a fraction of the cost.


## 🧬 Self-Evolution Mechanism

This is what fundamentally distinguishes GenericAgent from every other agent framework.
